🎓 Tutor Hiring System

A simple command-line application built in C++ that simulates a hiring process for tutors. This project demonstrates fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like inheritance and friend functions to evaluate applicants for teaching positions in Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics.

✨ Features
👥 Multi-Applicant Processing: Handles applications from multiple candidates in a single session.

📚 Subject-Specific Roles: Allows applicants to apply for Physics, Chemistry, or Math positions.

🧩 OOP Design: Uses class inheritance to model applicants and a friend function for eligibility checks.

⚠️ Input Validation: Includes basic exception handling for user input.

🚀 How to Run
Prerequisites
🛠️ A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, Clang, MSVC).
